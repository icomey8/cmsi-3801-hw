# Homework Template for CMSI 3801

Welcome!

**Homework 1**
- Worked on by *Jaime and Ian*. Daniel Munoz started in our group originally and provided the Question 3 code, but decided to work and submit individually moving forward.
- This assignment tested our existing understanding of Javascript and Python, and introduced a new language with Lua.

## The Test Suites

The test files are included in the repo already. They are available for YOU! They will help you not only learn the languages and concepts covered in this course, but to help you with professional practice. You should get accustomed to writing code to make tests pass. As you grow in your profession, you will get used to writing your tests early.

The test suites are run like so (assuming you have a Unix-like shell, modify as necessary if you have Windows):

### Lua

```
lua exercises_test.lua
```

### Python

```
python3 exercises_test.py
```

### JavaScript

```
npm test
```

### Java

```
javac *.java && java ExercisesTest
```

### Kotlin

```
kotlinc *.kt -include-runtime -d test.jar && java -jar test.jar
```

### Swift

```
swiftc -o main exercises.swift main.swift && ./main
```

### TypeScript

```
npm test
```

### OCaml

```
ocamlc exercises.ml exercises_test.ml && ./a.out
```

### Haskell

```
ghc ExercisesTest.hs && ./ExercisesTest
```

### C

```
gcc string_stack.c string_stack_test.c && ./a.out
```

### C++

```
g++ -std=c++20 stack_test.cpp && ./a.out
```

### Rust

```
cargo test
```

### Go

```
go run restaurant.go
```

## Grading Notes

Your grade is a reflection not only of your ability to write code to pass existing tests, but also of your ability to construct software in a professional setting. Therefore, the following will contribute rather heavily to your score:

- **Following all submission instructions**! Pay attention to every requirement such as replacing the contents of this readme file and including the names of all participants of any group work.
- **Keeping a pristine GitHub repository**. Do not push any file that does not belong (including but not limited to that silly `DS_Store`). Make sure all generated executables, intermediate files, third-party libraries, etc. are not committed. Your repo contents should be limited to your solution files, tests, configuration files, and `.gitignore` files.
- **Adherence to naming and formatting conventions for the language you are writing in**. Inconsistent indentation, for example, has no place in professional or student software. Neither does end-of-line whitespace, huge chunks of contiguous blank lines, and other types of messy coding practices that show friends, family, colleagues, and potential employers that you donâ€™t care about your work.
- (As always) The **readability and maintainability** of your code.
